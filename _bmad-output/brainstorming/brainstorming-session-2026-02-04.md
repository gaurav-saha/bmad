# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Gaurav Kumar Saha
**Date:** 2026-02-04

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Documentation Strategy for Agile Readiness
**Goals:** Create comprehensive documentation for every file, generate system overview, ensure agent compatibility

### Context Guidance

This brainstorming session focuses on software and product development considerations, specifically for **Agile Readiness**. We will explore:
*   **Technical Approaches**: Defining the structure for file summaries and system overviews.
*   **Integration**: Ensuring the output serves the @architect and @pm agents effectively.
*   **Success Metrics**: Defining what "comprehensive" and "compatible" looks like for this project.

### Session Setup

We are focusing on generating a robust documentation strategy. The goal is to move from a raw codebase to a fully documented system ready for Agile iteration. We will brainstorm:
1.  **Content Structure**: What specific details must be in every file summary?
2.  **System Overview**: Key interactions and architectural components to highlight.
3.  **Agent Protocols**: How to format this data so other agents consume it without friction.
